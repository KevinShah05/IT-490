# Yfood Web Application/Software as a Service

The project aims to help people with their eating habits by calculating their Body Mass Index (BMI) and giving them a calorie range which they should aim for depending on their goals. So, the users will be able to get proper recommendations on foods and recipes they can eat which conform to their specific needs, as well as exclude any food allergies. Users will be able to track their progress. In addition, there will be a feature that allows the user to enter the items in their fridge and give out recipes according to what they have on hand.
